# MousePad
MousePad is an application designed to let you control your computer with a game controller instead of a keyboard and mouse. You may find this useful whether you are playing games with a controller and don't want to switch between input methods back and forth, have limited mobility, or another purpose. For the purposes of limited mobility, please also look into our Phoenix Controller System which is designed to work with this application and improve your productivity and comfort with using a computer. This is a modification to a standard game controller that makes it easier to operate and consists of 3D printed parts which can be found on Printables: https://www.printables.com/model/571637-modified-xbox-controller-for-limited-mobility

The initial intent of the program was to help a client with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome use their computer more comfortably and increase their productivity due to the difficulty in using a keyboard and mouse.

The program consists of two main scripts. One runs in the background to connect to the controller and translate its actions into keyboard and mouse equivalents. The other is run on command and will let you change the settings abd button mappings from the default ones to better suit your needs in the form of a GUI application. These settings are stored in a json file and so they can be manually changed as well.

This was developed as part of a first year final engineering project at McMaster University in the ENGINEER 1P13 course by the following people:
