# MousePad
MousePad is an application designed to let you control your computer with a game controller instead of a keyboard and mouse. You may find this useful whether you are playing games with a controller and don't want to switch between input methods back and forth, have limited mobility, or another purpose. For the purposes of limited mobility, please also look into our Phoenix Controller System which is designed to work with this application and improve your productivity and comfort with using a computer.

The initial intent of the program was to help a client with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome use their computer more comfortably and increase their productivity due to the difficulty in using a keyboard and mouse.

This was developed as part of a first year final engineering project at McMaster University in the ENGINEER 1P13 course by the following people:

Shyavan, Soham, Frank, & Ibrahim
